    <h2>My story</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in Bariloche, a town in Argentinian Patagonia.
      I spent my early years living on a farm in the steppe, where my sense of connection to the earth and the living things started to grow.
    </p>
     <p>
      Quietly observing, trying to understand relationships between the landscape and the weather, plants, animals, and humans inhabiting it. 
      This is how I remember my childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a teenager, I started to connect with the mountains through hiking during my summer holidays.
      The freedom of exploring peaks, valleys, lakes, rivers, and forests was a spark that made me feel both alive and part of a greater whole.
      My analytical mind was also awakened by these landscapes.
      How did these vast mountains and valleys form? 
      Why are rocks in different areas so different?
      How will this landscape look in thousands of years from now?
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions remained with me as I finished high school, and I decided persue a degree in geology.
      During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to participate in several field trips and research projects that related geological processes and human activity.
      My masters thesis focused on understanding mass processes in the Andes and their implications for the geomorphology and local infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      After my graduation, and pushed by a desire for discovering its landscapes, I moved to Aotearoa New Zealand.
      Here, I worked in different industries related to agriculture, farming, hospitality, and landscaping, before starting my doctoral studies at the University of Canterbury.
    </p>
    <p>
     My PhD research focused on volcano geochronology, using cosmogenic dating and paleomagnetism to understand the recent evolution of Ruapehu, the largest stratovolcano in Aotearoa New Zealand.
      During my PhD, I developed my field skills by analysing the geology of most areas at this large volcano.
      I also expanded my laboratory skills, both in the geochemistry and geophysics fields, and I prepared and published my research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals.
    </p>
    <p>
      After finishing my doctoral studies, I joined Seequent, where as an application specialist I help geologists and software developers to improve workflows and software capabilities for geological modeling.
